cleansed and transformed using Python Pandas. The transformed dataset was then loaded into a final database (PostgreSQL) 
using the sqlalchemy engine.

Data Analysis and Visualization: The analysis and final visualization would be presented 
and displayed through HTML using the Flask API and JavaScript (Plotly.js, leaflet and D3.js)

A bar chart showing the top 20 countries with largest population in the world
A bar chart displaying the 20 world smallest countries by population.
A gauge plot showing the the percentage growth rate of each Country.
