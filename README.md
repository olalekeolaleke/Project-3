# Project-3 - World Population Review

The aim of the project is to analysis the World population by countries between 2021 and 2022. This 
will be achieved by taking into consideration the countries' population between the targeted years, 
their respective population growth rate and density.

The project was executed through following procedures;

Data Extraction, Cleaning and Transformation: Dataset was extracted from worldpopulationreview and kaggle website, and was 
cleansed and transformed using Python Pandas. The transformed dataset was then loaded into a final database (PostgreSQL) 
using the sqlalchemy engine.

Data Analysis and Visualization: The analysis and final visualization would be presented 
and displayed through HTML using the Flask API and JavaScript (Plotly.js, leaflet and D3.js)

Visualizations;
A bar chart showing the top 20 countries with largest population in the world
A bar chart displaying the 20 world smallest countries by population.
A gauge plot showing the the percentage growth rate of each Country.
A map showing the entire countries with a circle marker and a popup that displays each country's name and 2022 population on click.
